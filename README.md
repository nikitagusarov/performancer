# Performance Metrics for Discrete Choice Analysis

The package `performancer` provides a number of function to easily calculate many of the performance metrics used in classification and discrete choice analysis tasks. 
The main theoretical reference for this implementation is the handbook "*Evaluating Learning Algorithms : A Classification Perspective*" by Nathalie Japkowicz and Mohak Shah ([Cambridge University Press 2011](www.cambridge.org/9780521196000))



# Installation
